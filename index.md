When Suzannah Rowntree isnâ€™t travelling the world to help out friends in need, she lives in a big house in rural Australia with her awesome parents and siblings, trying to beat her previous number-of-books-read-in-a-year record. She blogs the results at <a href=http://www.vintagenovels.com/>Vintage Novels</a> when she's not writing historical fantasy fiction.

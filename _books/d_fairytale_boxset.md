Hidden in a dusty Indian village, Preeti Kamla hopes her bad luck is over...until the Demon Rajah claims her as his bride.

In imperial Byzantium, Michael the fisherman dreams of power and fortune. But will his ambition destroy the city and everything he holds dear?

Only a madman would go into Faerie of his own accord--and that's exactly what humble blacksmith John must do to rescue his lost love.

In Prohibition-era New Zealand, cabaret singer Ruby Black lives for thrills--but will she survive being mistaken for a dead girl?
